NAME
----
quvi-modules - Overview of the loadable quvi modules

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'quvi-modules' are a selection of importable modules implemented in Lua.
These modules are intended to be loaded ('require') from the
'libquvi-scripts(7)'.

Many of the modules are documented within the code. Refer to the
individual modules for their detailed description of different
available functions.

The modules are usually installed at::
  $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/common/quvi/

MODULES
-------

quvi/http/cookie::
  A set of functions that wrap most of the quvi.http.cookie function
  features. See 'quvi-object(7)'.

quvi/const::
  Constants. Technically, (due to Lua language specification) these are
  not immutable values. The 'constants' are used to interact with
  libquvi, e.g. specifying function operation modes and checking for
  returned libquvi return codes.

quvi/debug::
  An message output facility intended to be used for debugging purposes.
  By 'default', all output from scripts using this facility remain
  'disabled'. To enable the output, define the LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_VERBOSE
  environment variable.

quvi/entity::
  HTML entity conversion module. Converts the 'standard HTML entities'
  (to ASCII), and any numeric HTML entities to UTF-8 (using
  the 'quvi/html' module).

quvi/hash::
  Wrapper functions for some of the common hash (message digest)
  functions provided by the 'quvi-object(7)'. Note that these functions
  convert the given data into hexadecimal form before passing it to the
  hash functions.

quvi/hex::
  Functions for converting values from and to hexadecimal form. These are
  typically used together with the 'quvi-object(7)' crypto functions.

quvi/html::
  Converts numeric HTML entities to UTF-8. See also 'quvi/entity', which
  uses this module.

quvi/lxph::
  LuaExpat wrapper/utility functions for parsing XML, see also
  'quvi-modules-3rdparty(7)'.

quvi/stream::
  Media stream related functions.

quvi/util::
  Misc. utility functions.

quvi/youtube::
  Functions common to YouTube.
